             <h1> Alleys of Cumalıkızık,</h1>
             <p>
              For a taste of years gone by, head into the hill villages that sit on the outskirts of Bursa.<br>

              The most famous of these villages is Cumalıkızık, just 14 kilometers east from the central city.<br>
               Here, the cobblestone alleyways are rimmed with old houses, some finely preserved, and others slouching into various states of dilapidation. <br>
              They're built in typical Ottoman style, with stonework and adobe walls with wood beam detailing. <br>
              Some of the houses date as far back as the earliest period of the Ottoman era.<br>
              Some of the houses have been turned into cafés and restaurants, and many Bursa locals descend on the village during sunny weekends for lunch. <br>
              Various village locals have also set up stalls on the alleyways to sell traditional handicrafts.

              <h1> Iznik,</h1>
              <p>
                The historic lakefront town of Iznik is 77 kilometers northeast from central Bursa and so within easy day-tripping distance from the city.<br>
                Most people come here to see the preserved segments of the town's Roman-Byzantine walls,<br>
                 which once wrapped around the entire town. Various portions of the walls remain, as well as some of the original gates,<br>
                  the best being the Istanbul Gate in the northern section of town.<br>
                Today the town's ceramic industry has been revived,<br>
                 and there are various shops in the center where you can browse and purchase handcrafted tiles and other ceramic works.
